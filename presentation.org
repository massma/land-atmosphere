* Struggling towards reality: causality in land-atmosphere interactions
  With Olya and Pierre.
** Feedback
   - all is very welcome
   - in particular interested in:
     - anything that is confusing
     - how I can improve explanation
     - improve visualization
   - want to keep things as simple as possible while still achieving
     project goals
** Project Goal
   - Demonstrate the importance of controlling for [[file:graph.png][confounding]] in
     observational analyses
     - Confounding biases results!
*** Secondary goal
    - Provide some intuition/guidance for the variables that are most
      important to control/adjust for when attempting to estimate real
      land atmosphere causal effects from data (e.g., connect to
      Olya's efforts).

** Method
   - Use a [[https://classmodel.github.io/][land-atmosphere model]] to simulate the boundary layer in
     [[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kelowna,+BC,+Canada/][Kelowna, BC]]:
     - alternate realities where confounding does not exist.
     - causal experiments ("true" effect of soil moisture on evaporation)
   - Compare observational conclusions in the presence and absence of
     confounding to:
     1. Show the degree that confounding can bias results and conclusions
     2. Suggest which confounders bias results and conclusions the
        most (guide practitioners)

*** Alternate worlds
    - *Reality* (all [[https://class4gl.eu/][synoptic variables]] co-vary as they do in the real world)
    - *Randomized* (no confounding: synoptic variables)
    - *Selective confounding* (only certain synoptic variables maintain
      their true joint distribution with soil moisture):
      - Leaf area index
      - Day of year
      - Dynamics (u, v, initial boundary layer height)
      - Cloud Cover
      - Moisture (initial q, synoptic advection of q)
      - Temperature (initial T, Tsoil, Tground, and synoptic advection
        of temperature)
*** Regression analysis
    - *Fit a linear (least squares) model* of evaporation as a function
      of initial soil moisture in each alternate world
      - bootstrap to get uncertainty

    - Compare predicted soil moisture to the "true" causal effect of
      soil moisture on evaporation, as simulated by each model.
      - Understand how confounding biases results, and which variables
        are the strongest sources of confounding
** Sources of error
   - Model specification (e.g. linear model)
   - Sampling error (undersample the true joint distribution)
   - [[file:graph.png][Confounding error]] (induced co-variation between two variables
     that is not causal)
*** Competition 1 (sources of error)
    This is very high stakes.

    - Team Model Specification:
    - Team Sampling Error:
    - Team Confounding Error:
** Sources of confounding (or variable for adjusting for confounding)
   - Leaf area index
   - Day of year
   - Dynamics (u, v, initial boundary layer height)
   - Cloud Cover
   - Moisture (initial q, synoptic advection of q)
   - Temperature (initial T, Tsoil, Tground, and synoptic advection
     of temperature)
*** Competition 2 (sources of confounding)
   - Team LAI:
   - Team DOY:
   - Team Dynamics:
   - Team Cloud Cover:
   - Team Moisture:
   - Team Temperature:

** Conclusions
   - Confounding biases results. In this case, even more than a poorly
     specified (linear) model, and sampling error (< 1000 days of
     data).
   - Being thoughtful about confounding is arguably more important
     than using the most sophisticated non-linear regression
     techniques and finding/collecting the most samples.
   - (all conclusions conditional on this single site)

** Next steps
   - Repeat analysis for more sites:
     - *Goal*: understand how confounding and its sources vary as a
       function of climate & ecosystem.
